    "You have already seen that when you change the input value to a function, you often get a different output. For instance, consider an ``add_five()`` function that just adds five to any number and returns the result. Then ``add_five(7)`` will return an output of 12 (=7+5), and ``add_five(8)`` will return an output of 13 (=8+5). Note that no matter what the input is, the action that the function performs is always the same: it always adds five.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you might instead need a function that performs an action that depends on the input. For instance, you might need a function ``add_three_or_eight()`` that adds three if the input is less than 10, and adds eight if the input is 10 or more. Then ``add_three_or_eight(1)`` will return 4 (= 1+3), but ``add_three_or_eight(11)`` will return 19 (=11+8). In this case, the action that the function performs varies with the input.\n",
